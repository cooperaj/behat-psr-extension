Behat PSR Extension
==========

This [Behat](http://behat.org) extension allows you to more easily test your PSR7/11/15 applications and gives you the 
ability to isolate your application components at service boundries by injecting mocks/dummies/stubs into your running 
application instances at test time. 

For instance, you may want to isolate outgoing HTTP calls from Guzzle and mock the responses of those.
